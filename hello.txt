Lines of Logic

In the quiet glow of monitors at night,
We craft our worlds with keystrokes light,
Each semicolon, bracket, brace,
A puzzle piece that finds its place.

Bugs emerge like stubborn weeds,
We trace the flow, plant better seeds,
And when at last the tests turn green,
A sweeter victory's never seen.

From simple loops to systems vast,
We build the future from the past,
One function, class, and module more—
Creating what was not before.
